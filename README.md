# PokeAPI-RIB-SwiftUI

A modern iOS Pokémon app built with **RIBs (Router-Interactor-Builder)** architecture pattern, featuring a clean and scalable codebase with reactive programming using RxSwift and using SwiftUI as UI.

## 📱 Features

### Core Functionality
- **Pokédex List**: Browse through all Pokémon with pagination support
- **Pokémon Search**: Real-time search functionality to find specific Pokémon
- **Pokémon Details**: Comprehensive detail view with stats, abilities, and descriptions
- **Navigation**: Seamless navigation between Pokémon with previous/next functionality
- **Offline Support**: Local database caching using Realm for offline access

### UI/UX Features
- **Modern Design**: Clean, intuitive interface following Pokémon design guidelines
- **Custom Components**: Reusable UI components using SwiftUI
- **Dynamic Theming**: Color-coded Pokémon types with dynamic background themes
- **Image Caching**: Efficient image loading and caching with Nuke
- **Loading States**: Smooth loading indicators throughout the app

### Technical Features
- **RIBs Architecture**: Modular, testable, and scalable architecture
- **Reactive Programming**: RxSwift for reactive data flow
- **Network Layer**: Robust API integration with Moya and Alamofire
- **Local Storage**: Realm database for offline data persistence
- **Debug Tools**: Network debugging with netfox integration

## 🏗️ Architecture

This project follows the **RIBs (Router-Interactor-Builder)** architecture pattern, which provides:

- **Modular Design**: Each feature is encapsulated in its own RIB
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear separation between business logic, presentation, and routing
- **Testability**: Easy to unit test individual components
- **Scalability**: Simple to add new features without affecting existing code

## 🎨 Design

The UI design is based on the [Pokédex Community Figma design](https://www.figma.com/design/ZNuMRRQvD6yoOaJWRUYzk2/Pok%C3%A9dex--Community-?node-id=913-239&t=vrCYCG8zKjWgmkJP-1), featuring:
- Modern card-based layout
- Pokémon type color theming
- Intuitive navigation patterns
- Responsive design for different screen sizes
